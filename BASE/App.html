          a hard time relating to others socially, repetitive behavior patterns,

        <p class="block-one">
          Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's syndrome or
          Asperger's, was a diagnosis used to describe a neurodevelopmental
          disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social
          interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted,
          repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Asperger syndrome has
          been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
          and is no longer a diagnosis in the WHO's ICD-11 or the APA's
          DSM-5-TR. It was considered milder than other diagnoses which were
          merged into ASD due to relatively unimpaired spoken language and
          intelligence. The syndrome was named in 1976 by English psychiatrist
          Lorna Wing after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in
          1944, described children in his care who struggled to form
          friendships, did not understand others' gestures or feelings, engaged
          in one-sided conversations about their favorite interests, and were
          clumsy.[15] In 1990 (coming into effect in 1993), the diagnosis of
          Asperger syndrome was included in the tenth edition (ICD-10) of the
          World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases,
          and in 1994, it was also included in the fourth edition (DSM-4) of the
          American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
          of Mental Disorders. However, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013
          the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within
          autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive
          developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was
          similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International
          Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) in 2018 (published, coming into
          effect in 2022). The exact cause of autism, including what was
          formerly known as Asperger syndrome, is not well understood.[5] While
          it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been
          determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to
          play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying
          condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health
          Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that "treatment" of any form of
          autism should not be a goal, since autism is not "a disease that can
          be removed or cured". According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists,
          while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, "management of
          autism itself is chiefly about the provision of the education,
          training, and social support/care required to improve the person's
          ability to function in the everyday world". The effectiveness of
          particular interventions for autism is supported by only limited data.
          Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral
          therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and
          medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic
          characteristics tend to become less obvious in adulthood, but social
          and communication difficulties usually persist. In 2015, Asperger
          syndrome was estimated to affect 37.2 million people globally, or
          about 0.5% of the population. The exact percentage of people affected
          has still not been firmly established. Autism spectrum disorder is
          diagnosed in males more often than females, and females are typically
          diagnosed at a later age. The modern conception of Asperger syndrome
          came into existence in 1981 and went through a period of
          popularization. It became a standardized diagnosis in the 1990s and
          was merged into ASD in 2013. Many questions and controversies about
          the condition remain.

        <h3 class="empathy-aesp">Empathy In Asperger</h3>
        <p class="empathy-explain">
          People with an Asperger profile might not be recognized for their
          empathetic qualities, due to variation in the ways empathy is felt and
          expressed. Some people feel deep empathy, but do not outwardly
          communicate these sentiments through facial expressions or language.
          Some people come to empathy through intellectual processes, using
          logic and reasoning to arrive at the feelings. People with Asperger
          profiles may be bullied or excluded by peers, and might as a result be
          guarded around people, which could appear as lack of empathy. People
          with Asperger profiles can still be caring individuals; indeed, it is
          particularly common for those with the profile to feel and exhibit
          deep concern for individual rights, human welfare, animal rights,
          environmental protection, and other global and humanitarian
          causes.[50] Evidence suggests that in the "double empathy problem
          model, autistic people have a unique interaction style which is
          significantly more readable by other autistic people, compared to
          non-autistic people."
